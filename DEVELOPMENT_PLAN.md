## Introduction
The **Course Management System** is designed to streamline course, student, and faculty management, automate grade recording, and provide a robust reporting system. This plan outlines the development strategy, technologies, and schedule.

---

## Objectives
- Simplify course, student, and faculty management processes.
- Provide secure role-based authentication for users.
- Automate grade recording and generate reports efficiently.

---

## System Architecture
The system will follow a **3-tier architecture**:
1. **Frontend**: User interface built with React.js.
2. **Backend**: Business logic using Django/Flask.
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage.

---

## Features and Functionalities
- **Course Management**: Add, edit, and delete courses.
- **Student Management**: Enroll students, manage records, and record grades.
- **Faculty Management**: Assign courses and manage workloads.
- **Authentication System**: Secure login with role-based access.
- **Grade Recording**: Record grades and compute averages.
- **Reporting Tools**: Generate class lists, grades, and workload reports.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Django or Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## Development Phases
| Phase                  | Duration | Tasks                                     |
|------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Planning and Setup     | 1 week   | Initialize repo, setup tech stack         |
| Core Features          | 4 weeks  | Develop Course, Student, Faculty modules  |
| Authentication & Grades| 2 weeks  | Implement authentication and grade system |
| Reporting System       | 2 weeks  | Create dynamic reporting tools            |
| Testing and Deployment | 2 weeks  | Perform testing and deploy system         |

---

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Initial setup and planning.
- **Weeks 2-5**: Development of core features.
- **Weeks 6-7**: Add authentication and grading system.
- **Weeks 8-9**: Build reporting tools.
- **Week 10**: Final testing and deployment.

---

## Testing Plan
- **Unit Testing**: Verify individual components.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure modules work together.
- **System Testing**: Test the entire system end-to-end.

---

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Delays in development**: Use Agile methodology for incremental progress.
- **Data loss**: Regular backups and version control.

---

## Conclusion
This plan ensures a structured, step-by-step development of the Course Management System, delivering a secure, efficient, and user-friendly solution.
